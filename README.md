# Analysis of White Ancestry and 2016 Candidate Preference

This repository contains data and analytic code supporting the October 9, 2016 BuzzFeed News article, "[Inside The White Vote: Ethnic Germans, Italians Favor Trump And The GOP, Poll Finds](https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/trump-and-the-white-vote)".

## Data

The data in this repository were collected by the survey firm Morning Consult between September 22 and October 2, as part of its regular online political poll. At BuzzFeed News' request, the survey asked more than 5,000 registered voters to check which of the most common ancestry categories recorded by the Census Bureau applied to them, and also to pick the one ancestry they identified with most. You can find the [raw data here](data/BUZZFEED_DATA.csv). You can find a [list of the questions and the answer codebook here](docs/buzzfeed_questionnaire.docx).

## Analysis

You can find a [notebook containing the analytic code — and its output — here](notebooks/white-ancestry-and-trump-support.ipynb).
